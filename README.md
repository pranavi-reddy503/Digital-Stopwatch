# Digital-Stopwatch
A mini hardware implementation of digital stopwatch.
Overview:
A digital stopwatch is a device that measures and displays time with high accuracy, typically in seconds and fractions of a second. Unlike analog stopwatches, which use mechanical hands to track time, digital stopwatches use electronic circuits to process and display time readings. These devices are commonly used in various fields such as sports, science experiments, and general time-tracking activities.
A stopwatch will always have 2 buttons or modes, a start, and a stop mode. It may have other features but it will always have these. Additionally, we have added reset function too. This can be done with the pressing reset button of Arduino.

Components Required:
1.Bread Board.
2.Connecting wires.
3.Push Button switch.
4.LCD Display.
5.Potentiometer.
6.Arduino Uno.
